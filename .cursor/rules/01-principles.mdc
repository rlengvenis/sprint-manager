7. Review your changes before committing

## Questions to Ask Before Implementing
- Does this follow the existing patterns in the codebase?
- Is this the simplest solution that could work?
- Have I considered edge cases?
- Is this properly typed/validated?
- Have I added appropriate error handling?
